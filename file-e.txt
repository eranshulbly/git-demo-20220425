ohny, Johny
(Yes, papa)
Eating sugar?
(No, papa)
Telling lies?
(No, papa)
Open your mouth
(Ah, ah, ah)
Okay done
Johny, Johny
Check it
(Yes, papa)
Eating sugar?
(No, papa)
Telling lies?
[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
(No, papa)
Open your mouth
(Ah, ah, ah)
